# FluentBootstrap
## Overview
FluentBoostrap is a library designed to make working with Bootstrap easier in ASP.NET MVC environments. It enables using Bootstrap (and to some extent, regular HTML elements) in a variety of different ways without having to worry about HTML, CSS, etc. The end goal is to have strongly-typed classes, methods, and extensions that cover as much of the Bootstrap library as possible.
## Current Status
The bits are still being baked. More documentation will be provided as the library gets closer to completion. A NuGet package will also be provided.
